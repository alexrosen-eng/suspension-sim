how can I get the pointcloud of the tire to behave and move as a single body through the simulation
how will the simulation be setup in the first place??


THE BASIC SIMULATOIN

- iterate through the heave range
- move the inboard points one step length in the z direction
- optimize the outboard points to satisfy the length constraints between points on the same body
- For the tire, I don't want to create constraints for every single point in the point cloud
- I want to just look at the minimum z point, and assign a constraint for that iteration that it must be at a specific z distance
- The center of the tire can be connected to the other points of the upright 
- But what of the rest of the points? I can update the position, but what of the rest of the points of the tire pointcloud?

- Let's just define the wheel center and a vector extending in the y direction rotated by the static camber and the static toe
- Now 


HOW WILL THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM BE DONE?

- First define the points of the SYSTEM
- Next define the bodies of the system, which will define the constraints between the points
- Finally, define the system, which will be the collection of bodies
    - From the system, the points that are shared between bodies will be an additional constraint (of 0 length/coincident)
